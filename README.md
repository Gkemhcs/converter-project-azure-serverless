# SERVERLESS MICROSERVICES DEPLOYMENT IN AZURE
**In today‚Äôs rapidly evolving tech landscape, serverless architectures are gaining immense popularity. Companies are increasingly adopting serverless services to focus on coding and innovation rather than managing infrastructure. I‚Äôm excited to share a deep dive into my latest project that embraces this shift: Serverless Microservices in Azure. üåü**

## üåê Project Overview

### Components
1. **Frontend:**
   - The user interface is crafted to provide a seamless experience. It interacts with various backend services to perform operations and display results.

2. **Text-to-Speech Service:**
    - Converts user-provided text into speech.
    - The output is uploaded to **Azure Blob Storage.**
    - Generates a **Shared Access Signature (SAS)** for secure, time-limited access to the audio file.

3. **PDF-to-DOCX Service:**
    - Handles conversion of PDF files to DOCX format.
    - Stores the converted files in **Azure Blob Storage.**
    - Provides a SAS for users to download the file within a defined time frame.

4. **Video-to-Audio Service:**
    - Transforms video files into audio.
    - Uploads the audio files to **Azure Blob Storage.**
    - Issues a SAS to ensure secure access for a limited time.

### üîß Key Technologies and Services
-  **Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime):**
    - Facilitates service discovery and invocation, simplifying the development of microservices by abstracting away the complexities of the underlying infrastructure.
- **Azure File Shares:**
    - Ensures persistent and accessible file storage across all microservices, enhancing distributed storage file system.
- **Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server:**
    -   Manages transactional data, such as usage statistics and signed URL records, providing valuable insights into user interactions and system performance.
- **Authentication with Google Sign-In:**
    - Implements secure authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access the services.
- **Azure Container Apps:**
    - Deploys all microservices in a serverless environment, which simplifies the deployment and scaling of containerized applications.
- **Azure Blog Storage:**
    - Stores conversion outputs and allows to create a shared access signature (SAS) URL for users to download the file within a limited time.

#### Steps to deploy 
- **Step1**: First clone this repo to your local workstation 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gkemhcs/converter-project-azure-serverless.git
cd converter-project-azure-serverless
```
- **Step2:** Then first create a resource group and azure container registry to store our docker artifacts 
```bash
az group create  --name  converter-demo
az config set defaults.group=converter-demo
echo "Enter a unique name for azure registry"
read ACR_NAME
az acr create --name $ACR_NAME
```

- **Step3:** Then now we need to build and push images to azure container registry
```bash
az acr login --name  $ACR_NAME
cd frontend 
export IMAGE_SUFFIX=$ACR_NAME.azurecr.io/services
docker build -t $IMAGE_SUFFIX/frontend .
docker image push $IMAGE_SUFFIX/frontend 
cd ../pdf-to-docx-converter
docker build -t $IMAGE_SUFFIX/pdf-to-docx-converter .
docker image push $IMAGE_SUFFIX/pdf-to-docx-converter
cd ../text-to-speech-converter
docker build -t $IMAGE_NAME/text-to-speech-converter .
docker  image push $IMAGE_NAME/text-to-speech-converter
cd ../video-to-audio-converter
docker build -t $IMAGE_NAME/video-to-audio-converter .
docker image push $IMAGE_NAME/video-to-audio-converter
cd ..
```

- **Step4:** Now go to google cloud console create oauth credentials of type webapp if prompted for oauth consent screen complete it first, and copy the client-id and client-secret values

- **Step5:** Now we need to run bicep to deploy the project ,before that we need some parameters to run the deployment make sure you pass it correctly while prompted
```bash
echo "enter the google client id"
read GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
echo "enter the google client secret"
read GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
echo "enter the azure container registry name"
read ACR_NAME 
az deployment group create   --name converter --template-file bicep/main.bicep   \
--parameters bicep/converter.bicepparam \
--parameters googleClientSecret=$GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET  googleClientId=$GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID acrName=$ACR_NAME
```

- **Step6:** The above deployment has outputed  frontend url browse through the website ,but before  doing that  ,once go to google cloud console portal again paste the copied url in   **Authorized JavaScript origins** and for **Authorized redirect URIs** along with frontend url you copied add path to url **/.auth/login/google/callback**.

 
**Deployment completed**

**Now experience the website**
####  Steps to delete

```bash
az deployment group delete --name converter 
az acr delete --name $ACR_NAME
az group delete converter-demo 
```
